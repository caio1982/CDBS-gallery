CDBS gallery
------------

CDBS stands for Common Debian Build System, which is a sort of a framework to easily maintain and create Debian packages using "macros". This repository holds scripts and templates used to generate a gallery of CDBS usage (through debian/rules files), CDBS examples and statistics of all Debian packages using it.
